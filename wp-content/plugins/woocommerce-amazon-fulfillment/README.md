# WooCommerce Amazon Fulfillment
An integration between WooCommerce and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) by Never Settle.

## Description
This plugin integrates Amazon Fulfillment (FBA) with WooCommerce to provide a powerful automated shipping solution to store owners. It requires an active Amazon Pro Seller account and FBA service as well as MWS credentials which you can generate in your Seller Central dashboard. The plugin includes links to register for MWS credentials in the settings.

## Features 
* Ultimate flexibility: Select which individual products you want to be handled by FBA and which ones you want to manually fulfill
* Map Amazon Shipping Speeds to WooCommerce shipping methods (massively improved in version 1.1.0.1)!
* Automatically sends orders to FBA for fulfillment when payment is received
* Manually submit orders to FBA if necessary
* Easily track the current status of fulfillment orders on the normal Orders screen with support for both full and partial fulfillment (orders can be mixed)
* Fully integrated into standard WooCommerce conventions and processes like order status, order notes, etc.
* Supports THREE inventory sync modes: Update local product stock numbers from FBA inventory every time an order is placed; and/or update local stock numbers automatically on an hourly schedule; and/or manually trigger a full inventory sync from Amazon stock level numbers (also a good idea to do when setting up the integration)
* Supports international fulfillment through FBA as long as your FBA policy allows it, but also now supports turning OFF fulfillment for international shipping addresses as of version 1.1.0.1
* The customer receives a shipping notice from FBA when the order actually ships (this can be disabled as of version 1.1.0.2)
* The customer can access shipping and tracking information right from their View Order page in their My Account area
* Receive shipping notifications to your WP admin email address or set a different address to receive notifications
* Receive email notifications at the site admin address when an FBA submission fails and optionally turn those notifications OFF
* As of version 1.1.0.1 â€“ ALL new Smart Fulfillment decision engine with granular control of when NS FBA should or should not send fulfillment requests to Amazon at both the order and the item level
* Manual override settings to bypass other active conditions when an order is Manually sent to FBA
* Option to disable sending orders to FBA that match specific shipping methods
* Vacation Mode to enable sending to FBA regardless of product settings
* Perfection Mode to disable sending to FBA if ALL products in an order are not set to Fulfill with Amazon FBA
* Option to monitor for shipping status from Amazon and set the order status to Completed when shipping status has been detected
* And more!

## How it Works
* NS FBA adds a new option in the product settings shipping tab to turn on "Fulfill with Amazon FBA" per product
* NS FBA adds 3 new order statuses to WooCommerce: sent-to-fba, part-to-fba, and fail-to-fba
* These new statuses will be set automatically based on the results of the order submission to FBA. These statuses will also show unique icons in the Orders view so that you can quickly see where things are at. 
* Once everything is configured correctly per the instructions in the Installation section, NS FBA works automatically behind the scenes to send all order items marked for fulfillment to FBA when WooCommerce detects that the order payment is complete.
* Important note: This event is only automatically triggered with electronic payment gateways like Stripe, and PayPal. If you are accepting manual forms of payment like checks, the process will not be completely automatic. You will need to manually send the order to FBA using the new custom Order Action "Send to Amazon FBA" when you have received payment.  
* NS FBA also includes minor style tweaks to the existing Order Status icons to make them larger and easier to see based on Danny Santoro's post here: http://danielsantoro.com/customize-woocommerce-order-status-icons/
* The fulfillment request sends the proper data to trigger a shipping notification email from Amazon when it is actually shipped. This email will go to the customer's email address and the site's WordPress admin email address.
* Whether the fulfillment request is successfully submitted to FBA or not, in both cases, it will add an order note to the order with details and a link to the full log.
* If there is an error with an order submission to FBA it will also email the site admin a notification. NOTE: this functionality depends on a properly configured environment for PHP error_log() with the email parameter set to work.
* Note: NS FBA currently only syncs stock levels between Amazon and WooCommerce depending on your settings. It cannot sync or import other product data from Amazon (although that is on our radar to build)

## Installation
1. Install like any other plugin by uploading the zip through the WordPress dashboard and activating it on your WooCommerce site
2. Configure your MWS settings and options on the new Amazon Fulfillment menu item under the main WooCommerce menu
3. Test your API credentials with the test button to make sure your connection is working
4. Make 100% sure that all your SKUs in WooCommerce that you want to fulfill through FBA match your Seller SKUs inside FBA
5. Go through every product in WooCommerce that you want to send to FBA, check the new "Fulfill with Amazon FBA" option in the product general tab, and save
6. NS FBA for WooCommerce works behind the scenes to send all order's shipping information to Amazon
7. For manual forms of payment like checks, or to manually re-submit an order to fulfillment, you can use the new custom order Action "Send to Amazon FBA" (but use that carefully)
